Welcome to the C# Windows Form application for insurance claims!

## Demo

## Design

### Front-End

A login form takes you to the landing page for your account's role. Clients make insurance claims. Database admins control accounts and information flow. Financial managers view and manage claims.

### Controller

User information and the controls loaded into the front-end are stored within a Session object as properties.

### Database

Data is stored on our MySQL server on Butler's database.
